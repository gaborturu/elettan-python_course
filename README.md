This is the GitHub page for the programming course taught to PhD students of Semmelweis University. You can find all course related material here.

The course is on Wednesdays at 16:30 for Hungarian and Thursday at 16:30 for English speaking students. At the and of each weaks material there are some exercises (*homework*). You have to complete them before next week's session, and upload to **this** Google Drive link. Your final grade will be based on these homeworks.
