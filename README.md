# Entry level computer-programming for bio-medical students
This is the GitHub page for the programming course taught to PhD students of Semmelweis University. You can find all course related material here.

The course is on Wednesdays at 16:30 for Hungarian and Thursdays at 16:30 for English speaking students. At the and of each weaks material there are some exercises (homework). You have to complete them before next week's session, and upload to this **#todo:create link** Google Drive link. Your final grade will be based on these homeworks.

In this course you will learn the basics of the Python programming language. Python is an easy-to-learn but versatile programming language. During the course you will learn the basics of the language and the libraries used for data analysis (calculation, plotting).

There are several ways to get a working installation of Pyhton on your computers:

1. JupyterHub: in this case you will use a pre-installed version of Jupyter notebooks. It can be accessed only from the Semmelweis University network. It help us to start programming immediately (without installation problems etc.) even on the first day of course. However later we suggest to install a Python distribution on your own computer.
2. [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/): An online, browser based enviroment from Google. It can be integrated with your Google account. 
3. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download): a popular Python ditribution. We suggest to use Python 3.7 version for your operation system.
4. [Enthought Canopy](https://store.enthought.com/downloads/): an other Python distribution.  We suggest to use Python 3.5 version for your operation systems.
